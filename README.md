Nowadays, the stock market is popular for investment and profit-making. However, its volatility and unpredictability pose challenges for predicting future stock prices. In this study, machine learning (ML) models is used to analyze historical data and make accurate predictions. In this research the implementation of five commonly used ML models for time series data - Linear Regression, Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Autoregression, and ARIMA - is used to determine which model performs best in forecasting stock prices. The research question is, *** "Which machine learning model is the best for predicting future stock prices?" ***

* Dataset 

The dataset is retrieved for AAPL (Apple) stock, SONY (Sony) and THMO (Thermogenesis) from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance python library. The dataset includes time series data from 2016 to 2022, with seven features: 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', 'Volume', and 'Target'. The main focus is on the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' features, which provide important information about the stock's beginning price, volatility, fluctuation, and ending price for each day.
